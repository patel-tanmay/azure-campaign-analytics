# ðŸ§  Uplift Modeling on Criteo Dataset (Azure + Databricks)

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective

Digital ad budgets are often wasted on users who would convert anyway. This project focuses on **Uplift Modeling** â€” a causal machine learning technique that helps target only those customers who are *positively influenced* by an advertisement.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Maximize ROI by identifying users who are most likely to convert *because* of the ad, not despite it.
